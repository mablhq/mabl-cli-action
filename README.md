# BETA setup-mabl-cli

Github action to configure the
[the `mabl-cli` command-line client](https://help.mabl.com/docs/mabl-cli). It
installs the cli and configures it with an API key, if one is provided. Note
that API keys should be stored as secrets.

This action requires a version of node be installed as part of your workflow.
The [mabl-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mablhq/mabl-cli) will be installed into that node runtime.  
See below for an example of how to install node.

Note that this action and the mabl CLI are in BETA. Some interfaces may change
without prior notice.

## Inputs

- `version` {string} {optional} The version of the CLI to install. Defaults to
  latest if not specified.

## Environment variables

- `MABL_API_KEY` {string} {optional} If provided, this action will authenticate
  with the mabl CLI using the MABL_API_KEY.  
  The MABL_API_KEY should be stored as a repositor secret and pased as in the
  example below. Never store your MABL_API_KEY in plain test in your action.

## Requirements

- Requires node to be installed as a prior step. This is most easily done with
  the 'actions/setup-node@v1' command

## Example workflow:

```
